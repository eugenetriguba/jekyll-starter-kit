# Jekyll Starter Kit

This is a starter kit built for someone who wants a Rails-like feel while using Jekyll. I love the Ruby programming language and using the Rails framework which is why I built this starter kit, to give me a more familiar and structured feel when I use Jekyll.

Unfortunately, because GitHub Pages does not support jekyll-assets (see [issue #189](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/189)), this starter kit is for [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io) (which is free also) or a self-hosted solution such as [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/9f7ca951912e).

## So...what's included?

I tried to provide tools that help my workflow while also trying not to make too many assumptions since this should be a starting point for your next project.

 - [Jekyll-Haml](https://github.com/samvincent/jekyll-haml) - A templating engine for HTML. See [haml.info](http://haml.info) to learn more about HAML.
 - [Coffee-Script](http://coffeescript.org) - A little language that compiles into JavaScript.
 - [Font Awesome]()
 - [Jekyll-Assets](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-assets) - Asset pipelines for Jekyll.

This all makes writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript faster and more enjoyable.

## Looking to contribute?

It would be best to submit an issue detailing what you were thinking on adding or changing or contact me at [eugenetriguba@gmail](mailto:eugenetriguba@gmail). If you just have some suggestions on things that could be improved or bugs that need fixing, I'd also love to hear it also!
