# Jekyll Starter Kit

This is a simple starter kit I use that removes most of the typical set-up work I have to do.

Here are some of the gems and things I chose to include. They help with compatibility and making development easier.

 - [sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) - Sass makes CSS fun again.
 - [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - Makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
 - [bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon) - A Lightweight Sass Tool Set.
 - [neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat) - A lightweight, semantic grid framework built with Bourbon.
 - [bitters](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bitters) - Add a dash of pre-defined style to your Bourbon.
 - [modernizr](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr) - JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the userâ€™s browser.
 - [google analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) - Provide statistics for who visits your site. Just place your site ID code into the config file to activate it.
