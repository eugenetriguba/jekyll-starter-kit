# Jekyll Starter Kit

This is a starter kit built for someone who wants a Rails-like feel while using Jekyll. I love the Ruby programming language and using the Rails framework which is why I built this starter kit, to give me a more familiar and structured feel when I use Jekyll.

Unfortunately, because GitHub Pages does not support jekyll-assets (see [issue #189](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/189)), this starter kit is for [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io) (which is free also) or a self-hosted solution such as [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/9f7ca951912e).

## So...what's included?

I tried to provide general tools that help you develop quicker, manage your project easier, and be compatible with older browsers. I tried not to make too many assumptions about what will be built since this should be a starting point.

 - [jekyll-haml](https://github.com/samvincent/jekyll-haml) - A templating engine for HTML.
 - [sass](https://github.com/sass/sass) - Sass makes CSS fun again.
 - [coffee-script](https://github.com/rails/ruby-coffee-script) - A little language that compiles into JavaScript.
